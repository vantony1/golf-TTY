Few things to keep in mind while running the program.

There are two packages — GolfGame with the vast majority of the game’s method and Play with the main method and another method to jumpstart the game. 

The game sets the hole of each round to be at +/- 1 away from the distance variable

Given the various types of multiplayer golf games available, for the two player section of the game, first player one completes the hole and then player two completes the hole and their scores are tallied at the end to determine who won.

Also, for two player, if the first player skips then the second player automatically gets awarded par - 1 as score for that round. The second player is also only asked whether he wants to skip if player one wants to continue — for the sake of simplifying and making the scoring process more fair

There is two person version of the game where two human players can play against each other.

There is an human v computer option where an smart algorithm makes smart choices to beat the player — its not perfect but is an acceptable opponent. 

One can skip any round at any point by entering -1 for the club, or power if in the green. 
One can forfeit the game at any point by enter 0 for the club, or the power if in the green.
